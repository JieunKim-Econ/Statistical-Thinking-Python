# Statistical thinking in Python
This repository presents my replication and extension of the course **"Statistical thinking in Python"** from Datacamp.

## Course Description
After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. In this course, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.

## Main topics
1. Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Quantitative Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Thinking Probabilistically: Discrete Variables
4. Thinking Probabilistically: Continuous Variables
